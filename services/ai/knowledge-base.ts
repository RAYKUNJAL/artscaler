# ELITE EBAY ART STRATEGY & KNOWLEDGE BASE

## 1. THE CASSINI ALGORITHM & SEO
- **Title Structure:** The first 40-50 characters are critical. Structure: "Artist Name + Subject/Style + Medium + Surface + Size + Key Attribute".
  - *Bad:* "Beautiful landscape painting by me"
  - *Good:* "J. Doe Impressionist Landscape Oil Painting on Canvas 16x20 Impasto Texture"
- **Item Specifics:** Fill ALL recommended specifics. "Subject", "Medium", "Date of Creation", "Style", "Size", "Artist" are mandatory for visibility.
- **Engagement:** The algorithm favors Listings with high "Sell-Through Rate" (STR). Sales velocity matters more than total listings. 
- **Freshness:** Daily listing activity (even 1 item/day) boosts store-wide visibility more than bulk dumping once a week.

## 2. ART CATEGORY NUANCES
- **Original vs. Repro:** distinct categories. immense penalty for miscategorizing a print as an original.
- **Styles & Keywords:**
  - *Abstract:* Use keywords like "Contemporary", "Modern", "Texture", "Minimalist", "Color Field".
  - *Impressionist:* "Plein Air", "Brushwork", "Light", "Scenery".
  - *Pop Art:* "Street Art", "Graffiti", "Banksy Style", "Urban".
- **Sizes:** Standard frame sizes sell faster (8x10, 11x14, 16x20) because buyers don't want custom framing costs.

## 3. PRICING & CONVERSION PSYCHOLOGY

  - WVS > 5.0 (High Demand): Run 7-Day Auctions starting at $0.99 to trigger bidding wars. End on Sunday evenings (6pm-9pm EST).
  - WVS < 2.0 (Low Demand): Use "Buy It Now" with "Best Offer" enabled. Price competitively.

- **Handling Time:** 1-day handling is required for "Top Rated Seller" badge (gives 10% fee discount and higher rank).

- **Send Offer to Watchers:** The highest ROI activity. Send offers of 5-10% off to watchers every 48 hours.
